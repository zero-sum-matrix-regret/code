Run the python codes in a system with 64 CPU cores to see the results faster (will take 3 hours per code).

Regret-log1.py generates the log-log plot for the adversary that plays best-response right for all the T/2 steps.

Regret-log2.py generates the log-log plot for the adversary that plays plays either the equilibrium strategy or the best-response strategy depending on the strategy played by the algorithm for the first T /2 steps and plays the best-response strategy for the next T/2 steps.

Regret-log3.py generates the log-log plot for the adversary that plays plays the equilibrium strategy for the first T /2 steps and plays the best-response strategy for the next T/2 steps.

new-experiments.py contains the code 100*100 diagonal matrix
